# Stars Wars Info

Stars Wars Info site is an information resource about Starships from the Star Wars films.
This includes all the details you could ever want to know, including models, size, passenger
capacity, cost, crew size, hyperdrive ratings, and more!  All this is presented in a searchable
and sortable information site, so you can impress your friends with your astute
(and perhaps excessive) trivia knowledge.

## Project Structure

At the root of the solution there are 2 main project folders:
- __StarWarsInfo__: The backend API project, written in .NET as a REST provider
- __StarWarsInfoClient__: The React.js front end client application (via Vite)
